Unfortunatly, I do not have specific instructions on how to get our project running, due to the fact that getting our environment set up was a very painstaking process. If by some miracle your environment was identical or you are much better at understanding environments than me, then in order to get the project running you would have to:

	-Run the hospitalappdb.sql file to setup the database
	-Add the .php files included to the server you have hosted 	the database on
	-Load the mobileapp file into your IDE of choice
	-Debug the project using the serve to browser dubugging 	option. NOTE: Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing must be 	enabled

I know these instructions are lacking, this is due to the fact that our environment was difficult to setup and it would be ineffectual to attempt to describe setting up our environment in this readme. 

To compensate for this, I have included two video files demonstrating the existance and functionality of the app as well as the database.
